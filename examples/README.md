# Examples

These are examples of using the Factorio Learning Environment (`fle`).

There are a few ways to leverage the system.

## Python Library

See [`./python-library`](./python-library) for examples of using `fle` as a python import, using:
- The direct api
- The openai gym api

## Other Languages: gRPC

The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) interface provides a clean integration with other languages that support it.

See [`./grpc`](./grpc) for examples of using `fle` via gRPC.


## Other Languages: Command Line

See [`./cli`](./cli) for examples of using `fle` via its command line client.
